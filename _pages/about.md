<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by [Prof. Jingwen Leng](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~leng-jw/). I received the B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology (IEEE Pilot Class) from SJTU.

My research interests include machine learning compilers and high-performance computing. 

<!-- I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
